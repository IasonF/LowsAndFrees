It extracts the ETF codes from a broker's document 
([DeGiro commission free ETFs](https://www.degiro.co.uk/data/pdf/uk/commission-free-etfs-list.pdf)) and builds a database with their characteristics for easy comparison.
The app is also deployed and accesible on [AWS](http://lows.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
